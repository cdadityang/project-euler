Q: A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Ans: We'll iterate from 100 to 999 as they are 3 digits numbers, then multiply each of them, convert to string and compare for Palindrome by .reverse of string, then finally store it in "lar" variable if that multiplication is large

timer_start = Time.now
lar = 0
fnum = 0
num1 = 0
num2 = 0
(100..999).each do |n|
  (100..999).each do |m|
    fnum = n*m
    fstr = fnum.to_s
    if(fnum > lar && fstr == fstr.reverse)
      lar = fnum
      num1 = n
      num2 = m
    end
  end
end
puts "#{num1} * #{num2} = #{lar}"
puts "Elapsed Time: #{(Time.now - timer_start)*1000} milliseconds"
