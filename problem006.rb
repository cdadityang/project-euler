Q: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
	12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
	(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Ans: The logic is simple, just iterate from 1 to 100, and apply above formula.

=end

time_start = Time.now
sum1, sum2, sum3 = 0,0,0
(1..100).each do |num|
    sum1 = sum1 + (num**2)
    sum2 = sum2 + num
    sum3 = sum2**2
end
puts sum3 - sum1
puts "#{(Time.now - time_start)*1000} ms"
